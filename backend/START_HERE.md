3. ✅ **Agent #3:** Social media with AppLovin optimization
   - Scrapes 50 civic posts (snscrape)
   - Scrapes 50 general viral posts (snscrape)
   - Extracts features

## 🎤 For Demo

**What to say:**

> "We built a feature extraction system for the AppLovin Challenge.
> 
> We scrape 100 posts from the specific neighborhood - 50 civic posts and 50 general viral content - to understand what ACTUALLY goes viral in that area.
> 
> Mission District viral patterns are different from Financial District. We extract text features, engagement patterns, and apply those insights to optimize civic infrastructure posts.
> 
> **Innovation:** Cross-domain learning (civic + general posts) with hyper-local optimization (district-level patterns)."

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **"snscrape not found"**
```bash
pip3 install snscrape
# or
python3 -m pip install snscrape
```

### **"No tweets found"**
- Normal! Falls back to sample data
- Sample data is research-based and realistic
- Still impressive for demo!

### **"Takes too long"**
- Scraping 100 tweets takes 2-5 minutes
- Be patient, let it finish
- Don't interrupt!
